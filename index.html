<h2>BiNet/SBWN Holiday Party/ Food and Clothing Drive, Sat December 30th, 6:30pm</h2>

<p>
Hi everyone! With the holidays and winter season coming up it’s time to clean
out the closets and pantry of any unneeded clothes and dry/canned goods. Last
year’s drive was a big success and I know that this year’s can be just as
great!
</p>

<p>
All clothing with be donated to the Lambert House LGBTQIA Youth Shelter and
the goods will be donated to Lifelong and the Chicken Soup Brigade.
</p>

<p>
Together we can make the winter a little less cold for those in need.
</p>

<p>
There will be food and drinks, but feel free to bring snacks or beverages if
you want. All are welcome and my apartment is on the third floor, so there
are some stair to be aware of if anyone has accessibility needs. If you have
any questions feel free to message Elizabeth or ask them here on the event
page.
</p>

<p>
Hope to see you there!
