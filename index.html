<h2>Third Wednesday Adult Skate with DJ McLovin, Wed December 20th, 8:30pm</h2>

<p>
Every third Wednesday Adult Skate at Southgate Roller Rink.
</p>

<p>
First came the musical. Then the movie. And now you’re invited to ABBA SKATE on 
November 15th! Adult Skate with 21+ bar open for all you fans of ABBA that 
defined the golden-age of disco and dance music in the 70s.
</p>

<p>
Their compilation Abba Gold, released in 1992, is the second-highest-selling 
album of all time in the UK and has sold 29m copies worldwide, while the 
jukebox musical Mamma Mia!, which employs many of their hits, has grossed some 
$2bn since its debut in 1999, and only recently completed its Broadway run.
</p>

<p>
We will cover the best of ABBA on this evening and even some rare tracks and 
tracks from the musical and film. Wear your best 70's disco outfit too. This is 
going to be a great time.
